# [SKI SCHOOL PRO](https://ski-school-pro-2-4db020aae0bc.herokuapp.com)

The Ski School Pro (SKP) is a simple booking online project. It is based on a fictional small ski school that could be based anywhere in Europe! It is designed for instructors and customers alike. For the customers they can move around the site fluidly and see who the instructors are and book a ski lesson safely. For the instructors they can see which lessons they have, they also be able to alter their own bio’s. Please see the UX section for more details.

## UX

For the SKP design I had to consider the USER’S needs:
-	Website to be simple,
-	Easily fluid to get around the site,
-	Keep their data secure,
-	Option for the owner to have an administration section private only for the owner,
-	Implement CRUD design features & where needed defensive programming.


### Colour Scheme

With the colour scheme I used a combination of soft greys and blues to enhance the feeling of the cool winter season.

### Typography

I used the default Font from Bootstraps, as it stands out quite nicely. (Subject to change due time constrictions). I used the Font Awesome icons for the social media icons and altered the colours to reflect the colour scheme throughout the site. 

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.
